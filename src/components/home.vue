      responsively to achieve their goals and objectives, our research is
      focused on the interface of chemistry and biology, based on the experience
      and methodology of computational structural biology, and we hope to
      uncover the molecular mechanism of important protein in life sciences.
      Currently, our aim is to collect all biological databases to one platform
      and give an easy way to the scientific community for all scientific data,
      we strongly agree that every researcher should have access to important
      scientific information to aid in their study and research. For that, we
      freely provide access on easy and friendly finding way to scientific
      databases and tools (i.e. resources) in various life sciences research
      areas including proteomics, systems biology, genomics, biochemistry,
      molecular biology, transcriptomics, population genetics. We need to
      establish the benefits that the (HABDs-K) is for our users. This will
      enable us to continue to provide HABDs-k as a resource, freely available
      to the scientific community, and hope to develop HABDS-K to best meet your
      requirements. As biological data accumulate at larger scales and increases
      at exponential paces, thanks principally to higher-throughput and
      lower-cost DNA sequencing technologies, the number of biological databases
      that have been developed to manage such data deluge is growing at
      ever-faster rates. The major objectives of biological databases are not
      only to store, organize and share data in a structured and searchable
      manner with the aim to facilitate data retrieval and visualization for
      humans, but also to provide web application programming interfaces (APIs)
      for computers to exchange and integrate data from various database
      resources in an automated manner. Therefore, developing databases to deal
      with gigantic volumes of biological data is a fundamentally essential task
      in bioinformatics. To be short, biological databases integrate enormous
      amounts of omics data, serving as crucially important resources and
      becoming increasingly indispensable for scientists from wet-lab biologists
      to in silico bioinformaticians. According to ‘Fernandez-Suarez XM at all’
      Molecular Biology Database Collection in the journal Nucleic Acids
      Research, there is a sum of 1637 databases that are publicly accessible
      online. It should be noted, however, that such count of publicly
      accessible databases is conservative. In fact, there are some databases
      providing online services without publication in the peer-reviewed
      journal. We would love to hear your feedback, suggestions, or reports on
      errors or inconsistencies. The quickest way of reaching us is by
      contacting us directly on Email, Twitter. You can also use our lab's
      feedback form and we will direct your message to the appropriate expert.
      However, keep in mind we get a large volume of feedback, and although we
      read every message, we cannot guarantee a turnaround time.
