The goal of this study is to change the features of sandy soil so that it can hold more available water and assist the roots for better plantation. The role of hyperaccumulated plants in this study is to act as a bonding agent and carbon source, in addition to contributing to carbon sequestration for climate change mitigation. We hope that our findings may aid in future initiatives for converting deserts into farming lands.</p>

The age of genomics and big data has given rise to the need for cooperation and data sharing in order to make efficient use of this new information. The advancement of modern genomic technology such as microarrays, proteomics, transcriptomics, and gene sequencing has resulted in the generation of a huge amount of cancer data, therefore the first challenge of these multi omics cancer data was the design and use of electronic databases to store and manage the stormy amount of knowledge. </p>

Mardan, Khyber Pakhtunkhwakhua Pakistan which are many times greater than in other areas, we are attempting to control and communicate with deaf people's families under government acts, as well as manage CRISPER-Cas9 technological for future generations. For stopping this flood, we need a huge fund or international collaborations for which we are trying to manage.</p>
